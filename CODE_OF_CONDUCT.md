# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

I'm currently engaged in a solo project called Filmzee, which functions as both a personal challenge and a professional pursuit. Filmzee is a social media app with a two-fold mission. First and foremost, it aims to offer users a captivating platform for global social interaction and staying informed. As the sole developer of Filmzee, I have the unique opportunity to diversify my skill set, encompassing critical roles such as UI/UX design, front-end and back-end development, and product management.

Carrying the development of Filmzee throughout my college years will pose challenges as the app gains popularity and scales. I foresee the need to delve into system design to manage the expanding user base and growing complexity. Taking on this ambitious, long-term project promises to expedite my learning and provide experience that transcends the typical expectations of an entry-level engineer. By assuming all the necessary roles in building a real-world consumer app like Filmzee, I will acquire invaluable full-stack capabilities and problem-solving skills that usually require years of professional experience. This self-guided learning journey is set to transform me into a seasoned software engineer, well-prepared for the demands of the industry.

Filmzee is a testament to my self-driven approach to rapid skill enhancement and my growth as a software engineer. Managing the end-to-end development and launch of Filmzee allows me to diversify my skill set beyond what an entry-level role could offer at this stage.

Building the full-stack and managing all technical and product aspects of Filmzee from the ground up will shape me into an adaptable engineer ready to tackle any challenge in the industry. This project underscores my initiative to embrace ambitious self-guided learning outside the classroom and my ability to persevere through complexity. The depth of real-world experience that Filmzee provides serves as evidence of my commitment to excellence and continuous improvement as an engineer.

## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.



## 9. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
